# Meta Population Network Model

## Setup

After cloning or downloading the repository we need to set up a package manager to handle our dependencies, we choose Poetry for this task. You can install Poetry [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and learn how to use it [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/).

In the project root run the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Run

```bash
make run
```
